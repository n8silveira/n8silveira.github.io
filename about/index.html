		<p>As you could clearly tell from the name of this website, my name is Nathaniel (Nate) Silveira, and I'm a student
			at UMass Boston studying computer science.<br>I've always had a knack for creating things;
			whether that be drawings, animations, making online videos, or more recently--programming. Being able to
			proudly look at something I built from scratch has always filled me with a sense of pure joy and satisfaction,
			no matter how long or tedious the process took. This newly found sense of purpose began all the way back
			when I was still learning how to use the bathroom on my own. Our babysitter had my sister and I color, and
			I just remember being absolutely blown away at the mediocre drawing of this pair of 3D movie glasses we
			made. I was taken aback at the fact that there was once nothing on the paper we used. What was once a mere
			blank canvas is now an (arguably) realistic portrait of glasses, with just a little bit of elbow grease
			(or maybe it was child drool). Ever since then, I started learning how to draw and I even began making my
			own comic series where I'd produce weekly issues of completely fictional (yet original) characters and
			storylines. After a while, a friend in middle school taught me how to draw on the... computer (Wow!)
			My creative domain had transitioned from boring ol' paper and crayon to the ever-expanding internet! Now,
			I had every color and tool at my disposal so I learned how to animate my own cartoons. I began publishing
			them on YouTube which gained some traction as I earned a small following of a few hundred subscribers.
			This lasted for a couple years until I picked up a new hobby during the prime of COVID lockdown,
