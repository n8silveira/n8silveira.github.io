		<p>As you could clearly tell from the moment you opened up the home page, my name is Nathaniel (Nate) Silveira,<br>
			and I'm a student at UMass Boston studying computer science. I've always had a knack for creating things,<br>
			whether that be drawings, animations, making online videos, or more recently--programming. Being able to<br>
			proudly look at something I built from scratch has always filled me with a sense of joy and satisfaction<br>
			no matter how long or tedious the process took. The timeline of this new sense of purpose began all the way<br>
			back when I was still learning how to use the bathroom on my own. Our babysitter had my sister and I color and<br>
			I just remember being absolutely blown away at the mediocre drawing these 3D movie glasses we made. Ever since<br>
			then, I started learning how to draw and I even began making my own comic series where I'd produce weekly issues<br>
			of completely fictional (but original) characters and storylines. After a while, a friend in middle school taught<br>
			me how to draw on the computer (wow!!!) My creative domain had transitioned from boring ol' paper and crayon to the<br>
			ever-expanding internet! Now, I had every color and every tool at my disposal so I learned how to animate my own cartoons<br>
			I began publishing them on YouTube and gained a small following of a few hundred subscribers.
