		<p>As you could clearly tell from the name of this website, my name is Nathaniel (Nate) Silveira, and I'm a student
			at UMass Boston studying computer science.<br>Besides my love for music, there's more behind just the pretty
			face you might subject me to. I've always had a knack for creating things; whether that be drawings, animations,
			making online videos, or more recently--programming. Being able to proudly look at something I built from
			scratch has always filled me with a sense of pure joy and satisfaction, no matter how long or tedious the
			process took. This newly found sense of purpose began all the way back when I was still learning how to use
			the bathroom on my own. Our babysitter had my sister and I color, and I just remember being absolutely blown
			away at the mediocre drawing of this pair of 3D movie glasses we made. I was taken aback at the fact that there
			was once nothing on the paper we used. What was once a mere blank canvas is now an (arguably) realistic portrait
			of glasses, with just a little bit of elbow grease (or maybe it was child drool). Ever since then, I started
			learning how to draw and I even began making my own comic series where I'd produce weekly issues of completely
			fictional (yet original) characters and storylines.
			After a while, a friend in middle school taught me how to draw on the... computer (Wow!)
			My creative domain had transitioned from boring ol' paper and crayon to the ever-expanding internet! Now,
			I had every color and tool at my disposal so I learned how to animate my own cartoons. I began publishing
			them on YouTube which gained some traction as I earned a small following of a few hundred subscribers.
			This lasted for a couple years and it was during lockdown when music became my favorite form of art and expression.
			I really got into the rap scene first, and I had watched <a href="https://youtu.be/U0VwxiLiHk8?si=UluhRf3jU006QonS" target ="_blank">this video</a>
			by Andy Rants where he ranked every Kanye West song from his least favorite to his favorite. I figured I wanted
			to do the same thing. So I did... And here I am with a PLAYLIST of different artists I've covered.
