		<p>My name is Nathaniel (Nate) Silveira and I am a student at UMass Boston studying computer science.<br>
		   	Creating things has always filled me with joy and satisfaction. Ever since I was little I would draw<br>
			my own comics filled with made-up characters and storylines. Then I learned how to draw digitally and animate<br>
			so I began producing these parodies of already existing franchises as practice.
